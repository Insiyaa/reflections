When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I own a desktop. So when I'll be leaving my place and want to continue my project, I would want to use remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I must get chance to decide it. Maybe I want to complete a file before syncing it with my machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Cloning repositories among gitHub servers.
    Clone: Cloning from gitHub to computer and from one location on a machine to another.
    Branch: To create a new branch in the same project.
